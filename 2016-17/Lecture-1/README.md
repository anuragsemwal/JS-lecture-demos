To run the demos, run snippets from the demo you want inside
the console, or put them in an HTML page.

```html
<script type = "text/javascript">
	// Code snippet
</script>
```

Read the files for helpful hints.

Alternatively, the JavaScript demos given here could be loaded into
the browser.

```html
<script type = "text/javascript" src = "filename.js"></script>
```

You can play with the demos using the console (F12).
